# Maps

This project accommodates thousands of coordinates I collected over the years with [Strava](https://strava.com). Bike trips, skiing or hiking activities were recorded into a gpx file and then compiled into JSON data arrays through Python. 
Strava still offers more comprehensive features, such as altitude tracking, time, average speeds etc. Still, I wanted to play around with different visual styles of [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com) and [Thunderforest](https://thunderforest.com) API maps and mark my waypoints and routes.

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run dev # serve examples at localhost:5173
```
